# hd-wallet

I started this project as a way to learn how does a Bitcoin transsaction work at the software level and ended up using this topic and repo as part of my Barchelos final project (*Bitcoin Wallet: simulaci√≥n de una criptomoneda*).

This repo was inspired by the amazing website [leanmeabitcoin](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/) and O'Reilly books [Mastering Bitcoin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-bitcoin-2nd/9781491954379/) && [Programming Bitcoin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-bitcoin/9781492031482/).
